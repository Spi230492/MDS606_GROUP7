## AI in financial fraud detection

## Research Question
How AI based approaches improve the performance of financial transaction fraud detection systems, and what are the major attributes who play role in system effectiveness?

## Hypothesis 1

Advance Machine learning models (like random forest or XGBOOST) can significantly decrease the number of false positives in fraud detection compared to traditional rule-based systems, by identifying subtle patterns in transaction data.

## Hypothesis 2 :
Deep learning techniques, such as Convolution neural network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, can improve fraud detection performance in sequential data by capturing temporal dependencies and detecting complex fraudulent behaviour.

## Data collection
Pre-collected dataset will be used for data analysis
