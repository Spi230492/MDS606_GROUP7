## Hypothesis 1 :
Deep learning techniques, such as Convolution neural network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, can improve fraud detection performance in sequential data by capturing temporal dependencies and detecting complex fraudulent behaviour.

## Data collection
Pre-collected dataset will be used for data analysis
